# FIR Filter Design and Implementation
Advanced VLSI Design - Course Project | ECSE 6680 
 
## Overview

kateThis project is centered around the design and implementation of a low-pass Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter with specific characteristics. The aim was to create a filter with [insert specifics about the filter, such as tap number, transition band, etc.]. A unique approach was employed by utilizing [insert any unique methodologies].

## Design Process

### MATLAB FIR Filter Design

The FIR filter was designed in MATLAB using the [insert specific functions/toolboxes] functions, which allowed for the precise definition of the filter's specifications. The design process involved [briefly explain the process and any specific choices made].

### Verilog Implementation

The Verilog implementation involved structuring the filter as [explain structure, such as using a shift register, adders, etc.]. The code adheres to [mention any specific design patterns or principles followed]. The filter was implemented with the following hierarchy:

### Architecture

Detail the architecture of your pipelined and/or parallelized FIR filter. Include diagrams if possible.

## Results

### Frequency Response Analysis
