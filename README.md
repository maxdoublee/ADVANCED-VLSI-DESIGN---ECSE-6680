# ADVANCED-VLSI-DESIGN---ECSE-6680
This ECSE 6680 GitHub repository documents the development of a 100-tap low-pass FIR filter using Matlab and Verilog. It includes not just source code but also analyses of Matlab's design role, Verilog structure, and architectural choices between pipelining and parallel processing, supported by industry tools. Hardware implementation details are recorded, showcasing metrics like area, frequency, and power, alongside a comprehensive analysis section. This repository  will also feature a final design project demonstrating a broad skillset in VLSI architecture and RTL coding.
